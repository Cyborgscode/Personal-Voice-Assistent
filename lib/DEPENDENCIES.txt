for the new IMAP Notification Service, we need this package:

javax.mail package from https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/com/sun/mail/javax.mail/1.6.2/javax.mail-1.6.2.jar
javax.activation package from https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sun.activation/javax.activation/1.2.0/jar

Compile instructions change to :

cd /usr/share/pva

CP=""
for file in lib/*;do  CP="$CP:./$file"; done 
javac PVA.java -cp "$CP:."

for special releases:

javac --release 8 PVA.java -cp "$CP:."
